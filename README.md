# üõí Ecommerce Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on an Ecommerce dataset using **SQL Server**. The goal is to uncover valuable business insights related to revenue trends, user behavior, product performance, discount effectiveness, and category-based patterns. The analysis leverages SQL techniques such as window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), aggregation, and ranking to answer critical business questions.

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this project includes records from an Ecommerce platform and contains the following columns (among others):

- `User_ID`
- `Product_ID`
- `Category`
- `Price`
- `Final_Price`
- `Discount (%)` *(renamed to `Discount`)*
- `Purchase_Date`
- `Payment_Method`

The dataset was cleaned and normalized (e.g., renaming columns, correcting data types) before analysis.

##  Sample Query Snippet

```sql
-- Who are the top 5 spending users each month?
WITH MonthlySpending AS (
  SELECT 
    SUM(final_price) AS TotalSpent, 
    USER_ID, 
    MONTH
  FROM Ecommerce
  GROUP BY MONTH, User_ID
),
SpendingRank AS (
  SELECT *, 
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY MONTH ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC) AS Rank
  FROM MonthlySpending
)
SELECT * 
FROM SpendingRank
WHERE Rank <= 5;
